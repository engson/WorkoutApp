instructions = [
    "Stand with your mid-foot under the barbell.",
    "Bend over and grab the bar with a shoulder-width grip.",
    "Bend your knees until the bar almost touches your shins.",
    "With a neutral spine, flex your butt and brace your stomach.",
    "Pick the bar up off the ground (It helps to think “press DOWN into the floor with your feet through your heels”).",
    "Continue pressing down with your legs until the barbell passes your knees, then thrust your hips forward until you are standing up.",
    "Reverse your movement until the bar returns to its starting place on the ground."

name = "Benchpress"
description = "Benchpress with barbell"
instructions = [
    "Lay faceup on a horizontal bench, with your butt on the bench and feet flat on the ground.",
    "Grasp the barbell with an overhand grip wider than shoulder width.",
    "Tuck your shoulder blades behind your back – this will help keep your elbows from flaring out too much.",
    "Inhale, lift up the bar and lower it to the center of your chest, in a controlled movement, maintaining pressure on your feet the entire time",
    "Once the bar touches your chest, press the weight back up explosively, and exhale at the end of each rep."
]
tips = [
    "Press on the floor hard with your feet – this will create a slight arch in your back, with your weight of your body resting on the back of your shoulders and your butt",
    "The bar should travel in a slight arc forward, in order to reach the center of your chest.",
    "Never use a false grip. A false grip (aka thumbless or suicide grip) is when you don’t wrap your thumbs around the bar.",
    "Tucking in your elbows also reduces the pressure on your shoulders."

    "Dismount the barbell and step backward carefully. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart and pointing slightly outwards.",
    "Inhale as you squat down by simultaneously pushing your butt backward and bending your knees forward. Keep your torso upright, and descend at least until your knees are bent at a 90-degree angle.",
    "Exhale as you push your body back up to the starting position, driving through your heels and keeping your torso upright and core tight.",
